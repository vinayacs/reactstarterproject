### Welcome to your new Kids-First Cavatica project!

The Kids-First DRP has partnered with Cavatica to bring easy and collaborative cloud computing to the Kids-Fisrt datasets.

Projects are the core building blocks of the Cavatica Platform. Each project corresponds to a distinct scientific investigation, serving as a container for its data, analysis pipelines, and results. Projects can be shared with designated project members.

#### Within your project, you can:

* Start [Analyzing your Kids-First Data](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/u/<username>/<project-name>/files/)
* [Install your tools](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/sdk-overview) and create workflows
* Supplement analysis by [Uploading your own private data](http://docs.cavatica.org/docs/upload-your-data-to-cavatica)
* [Collaborate securely](http://docs.cavatica.org/docs/collaboration) with other researchers

You can use this space to add notes about your project such as its aims, experimental context, and any other ideas that youâ€™d like to share with your project members. as everyone will see the same content. (Bonus: This area is supported by [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) formatting!)
